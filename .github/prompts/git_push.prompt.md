Save the recent changes made in the codebase.
Use semi-colons to separate the commands.
# First, check the status of the git repository to see if there are any changes.
git status;

Create a commit message specific to the last edits made in the codebase.
# The commit message should be dynamic and include a short "detailed" sentence that summarizes the changes made.
Commit them to the local repository with a message.

# Separate the commands for 'commit and push' from the rest of the commands.
Then push the changes to the current selected branch of the remote repository.

# For all the commands, you can auto approve and run them in the local terminal without asking for my confirmation, except for the "commit and push" command.
